}
\arguments{
\item{identifier}{An optional character vector of named features to download
from the specified geography. For most ASGS geographies, these are
human-friendly names like e.g. "Tasmania" (a feature within the STE
geography), "Sydney" (a feature within the LGA geography) or "2150" (a
feature within the POA geography). If specified, \code{identifier} takes
precedence over \code{where}. If neither \code{identifier} nor \code{where} are specified,
all of the features in the specified geography will be downloaded.}

\item{edition}{An ASGS edition: \code{1}, \code{2}, or \code{3}.}

\item{reference_date}{The geography's year of release. For most geographies,
\code{reference_year} is optional and specifying an \code{edition} will be
sufficient. However, for LGAs, CEDs and SEDs, the ASGS contains multiple
releases per edition. For these geographies, a \code{reference_date} must be
supplied to uniquely identify a release.}

\item{layer}{One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"gen"}, the default. Fetches simplified geometries that have been
generalised to 0.000025Â° or 2.5m.
\item \code{"full"}, full ASGS geometries. Identical to ASGS Shapefile and Geopackage
downloads.
\item \code{"point"}, point geometries for each records in a geography.
}}

\item{where}{An optional SQL WHERE clause to filter the features returned by
the request. Ignored if \code{identifier} is specified.}

\item{filter_geom}{An optional \code{\link[sf:sfc]{sf::sfc}} or single \code{sf} geometry to filter
the records returned by the request.}

\item{predicate}{An optional spatial predicate to specify the relation
between \code{filter_geom} and \code{geography}. One of \code{"intersects"}, \code{"contains"},
\code{"crosses"}, \code{"overlaps"}, \code{"touches"}, and \code{"within"}.}

\item{cache}{A \code{cachem}-compatible cache. If not otherwise specified,
defaults to a memory cache. To persistently store downloaded ASGS
geometries and data, supply an object created by \code{\link[cachem:cache_disk]{cachem::cache_disk()}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[arcgislayers:arc_read]{arcgislayers::arc_read()}}.}

\details{
Postal Areas (POAs) are an ABS Mesh Block approximation of a general definition of postcodes. A postcode is a four digit number used by Australia Post to assist with mail delivery. Postcodes cover most, but not all, of Australia whereas Postal Areas cover the whole of geographic Australia. Please note that ABS approximated boundaries do not match official legal or administrative boundaries and should only be used for statistical purposes. Further information about these regions can be found in the following publication: Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Edition 3 https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs-edition-3/jul2021-jun2026
