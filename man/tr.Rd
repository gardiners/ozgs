  edition = NULL,
  reference_date = NULL,
  layer = c("gen", "full", "point"),

}
\arguments{
\item{edition}{An ASGS edition: \code{1}, \code{2}, or \code{3}.}

\item{reference_date}{The geography's year of release. For most geographies,
\code{reference_year} is optional and specifying an \code{edition} will be
sufficient. However, for LGAs, CEDs and SEDs, the ASGS contains multiple
releases per edition. For these geographies, a \code{reference_date} must be
supplied to uniquely identify a release.}

\item{layer}{One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"gen"}, the default. Fetches simplified geometries that have been generalised to 0.000025Â° or 2.5m.
\item \code{"full"}, full ASGS geometries. Identical to ASGS Shapefile and Geopackage downloads.
\item \code{"point"}, point geometries for each records in a geography.
}}

\item{where}{An optional SQL WHERE clause to filter the records returned by
the request.}

\item{filter_geom}{An optional \code{\link[sf:sfc]{sf::sfc}} or single \code{sf} geometry to filter
the records returned by the request.}

\item{predicate}{An optional spatial predicate to specify the relation
between \code{filter_geom} and \code{geography}. One of \code{"intersects"}, \code{"contains"},
\code{"crosses"}, \code{"overlaps"}, \code{"touches"}, and \code{"within"}.}

\item{cache}{A \code{cachem}-compatible cache. If not otherwise specified,
defaults to a memory cache. To persistently store downloaded ASGS
geometries and data, supply an object created by \code{\link[cachem:cache_disk]{cachem::cache_disk()}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[arcgislayers:arc_read]{arcgislayers::arc_read()}}.}

\details{
Tourism Regions (TRs) are an ABS SA2 approximation of tourism regions as provided by Tourism Research Australia. They are administrative regions primarily used by Tourism Research Australia for research and policy purposes. Please note that ABS approximated boundaries do not match official legal or administrative boundaries and should only be used for statistical purposes. Further information about these regions can be found in the following publication: Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Edition 3 https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs-edition-3/jul2021-jun2026
