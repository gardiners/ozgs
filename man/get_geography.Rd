\arguments{
\item{geography}{The name of the ASGS geography to download. Valid choices
are ADD, AUS, CED, DZN, GCCSA, IARE, ILOC, IREG, LGA, MB, NRMR, POA, RA, S/T, SA1, SA2, SA3, SA4, ..., TR, and UCL.}

\item{identifier}{An optional character vector of named features to download
from the specified geography. For most ASGS geographies, these are
human-friendly names like e.g. "Tasmania" (a feature within the STE
geography), "Sydney" (a feature within the LGA geography) or "2150" (a
feature within the POA geography). If specified, \code{identifier} takes
precedence over \code{where}. If neither \code{identifier} nor \code{where} are specified,
all of the features in the specified geography will be downloaded.}

\item{edition}{An ASGS edition: \code{1}, \code{2}, or \code{3}.}

\item{reference_date}{The geography's year of release. For most geographies,
\code{reference_year} is optional and specifying an \code{edition} will be
sufficient. However, for LGAs, CEDs and SEDs, the ASGS contains multiple
releases per edition. For these geographies, a \code{reference_date} must be
supplied to uniquely identify a release.}

\item{layer}{One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"gen"}, the default. Fetches simplified geometries that have been
generalised to 0.000025Â° or 2.5m.
\item \code{"full"}, full ASGS geometries. Identical to ASGS Shapefile and Geopackage
downloads.
\item \code{"point"}, point geometries for each records in a geography.
}}

\item{where}{An optional SQL WHERE clause to filter the features returned by
the request. Ignored if \code{identifier} is specified.}

\item{filter_geom}{An optional \code{\link[sf:sfc]{sf::sfc}} or single \code{sf} geometry to filter
the records returned by the request.}

\item{predicate}{An optional spatial predicate to specify the relation
between \code{filter_geom} and \code{geography}. One of \code{"intersects"}, \code{"contains"},
\code{"crosses"}, \code{"overlaps"}, \code{"touches"}, and \code{"within"}.}

\item{cache}{A \code{cachem}-compatible cache. If not otherwise specified,
defaults to a memory cache. To persistently store downloaded ASGS
geometries and data, supply an object created by \code{\link[cachem:cache_disk]{cachem::cache_disk()}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[arcgislayers:arc_read]{arcgislayers::arc_read()}}.}
}
\value{
Returns a \code{sf} spatial data frame with geometry and data for the
requested ASGS geography.
}
\description{
\code{get_geography()} downloads and caches the geometries and data defined by a
specified ASGS geography, with optional filtering using SQL or spatial
queries.
