Description: Access maps, layers and data provided by the Australian Statistical
  Geography Standard (ASGS) via the ABS web service. Available spatial objects
  include Indigenous Structures, Statistical Areas (SA1, SA2, SA3 and SA4), states
  and territories, postcode approximations (POAs), suburbs and localities, local
  government areas (LGAs), state and federal electorates, remotness areas and the 
  mesh blocks from which each of these are constructed. Requests are cached to
  avoid repeatedly fetching large quantities of data from the ABS web servers.
  Convenience functions are provided to simplify geometries as they are fetched,
  for quick and simple plotting in R.
